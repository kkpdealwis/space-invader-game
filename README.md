## Space Invader Game
This repo contains the space invader game which has been developed using pygames. This project was done as a learning experiment to improve python coding

* Requirements:
  ```
    pip install pygame
  ```
* Used maths equations
  * distance formula for two points
    ```
      d=√((x2 – x1)² + (y2 – y1)²)
    ```
  * In case of a two-dimensional plane, the two points lie along x-axis and y-axis. The distance of a point from the y-axis is known as its x-coordinate or abscissa. The distance of a point from the x-axis is known as its y-coordinate, or ordinate. The coordinates of a point on the x-axis and y-axis are of the form (x, 0) and (0, y), respectively.
